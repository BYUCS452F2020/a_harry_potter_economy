I have always been interested in making/maintaining a Reddit bot but haven't found the time yet, I think this will be a very fun project to get my feet wet.

Business:
From a money making standpoint I don't think there is a way to make profit off of a Reddit bot (legally), but learning how to connect/read/interact 
with other companies API's is a very good skill to have for a future busniess.

Legal:
I have no idea what I am supposed to say here but I'm sure this project is within Reddit's ToS.

Technical:
I don't have much experience with Reddit bots but I am proficient in Python. I also have worked with a few noSQL databases before, 
namely Google Firestore/Firebase and AWS DynamoDB
